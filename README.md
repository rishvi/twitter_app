===========

Some basic twitter api calls implementation.

## How To Use
Place the entire folder on a webserver. Open the index.php and enter a username whose records are to be returned. The demo for the same is available at http://mediawave.in/rishvi/twitter/index.php

The access tokens used in the settings array in config.php belong to my developer account. They can be edited to use any account details. 

*Note: PHP Wrapper for Twitter API v1.1 is used from https://github.com/J7mbo/twitter-api-php

**Note: Number of requests made from a developer account to twitter api are restricted for a time period. Please go through https://dev.twitter.com/docs/rate-limiting/1.1 to understand better.
